## Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science - DeepLearning AI

**Description**: Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science is a foundational online program created by DeepLearning AI and taught by Luis Serrano. In machine learning, you apply math concepts through programming. And so, in this specialization, you‚Äôll apply the math concepts you learn using Python programming in hands-on lab exercises. As a learner in this program, you'll need basic to intermediate Python programming skills to be successful.

Many machine learning engineers and data scientists need help with mathematics, and even experienced practitioners can feel held back by a lack of math skills. This Specialization uses innovative pedagogy in mathematics to help you learn quickly and intuitively, with courses that use easy-to-follow visualizations to help you see how the math behind machine learning actually works. 

**Duration**: 93 hours
